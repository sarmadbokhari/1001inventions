His travel account, the Rihla, provides valuable insights into the medieval world, its cultures, peoples, and geography, making him one of history's greatest travelers."
Al-Idrisi,1099-1166,"Geography, Cartography",Creating detailed world maps and geographical works,"Al-Idrisi was commissioned by the Norman King Roger II of Sicily to create a world map. The resulting work, known as the Tabula Rogeriana (1154), was the most accurate world map of its time. His accompanying book ""Nuzhat al-Mushtaq"" contained detailed information about the world's regions, peoples, and trade routes. His cartographic work influenced European exploration for centuries."
Ibn Khaldun,1332-1406,"History, Sociology, Economics, Political Science",Founding modern sociology and historiography,"Ibn Khaldun wrote Al-Muqaddimah (The Introduction), a groundbreaking work on universal history that established the foundations of several social sciences. He developed theories on social cohesion, economic development, and the rise and fall of civilizations. He is considered the father of sociology, historiography, and economics, introducing scientific methods to the study of society centuries before Western scholars."
Al-Khwarizmi,780-850 (approximate),"Mathematics, Astronomy, Geography",Developing algebra and introducing Hindu-Arabic numerals to the West,"Al-Khwarizmi's work on algebra (the word ""algebra"" comes from the title of his book ""Al-Jabr"") laid the foundations for this branch of mathematics. He introduced the decimal positional number system to the Western world and developed the concept of the algorithm (which is derived from his name). His geographical work included coordinating the project to determine Earth's circumference."
Ibn al-Nafis,1210-1288,"Medicine, Anatomy, Physiology",Discovering pulmonary circulation,"Ibn al-Nafis was the first to describe the pulmonary circulation of the blood, challenging Galen's incorrect theory that had dominated medicine for over a millennium.
